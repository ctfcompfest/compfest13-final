## Description
"*hmm*", said the villagers, wondering why they're gathered in the middle of nowhere. What's their purpose? Are they carrying something? And why there's an item frame in the middle? Are you not curious?

## Difficulty
medium

## Hints
* An item frame, could it be, a placeholder for something. Could it be, ahh no, there's no way it's for an item. Why would they gathered just to assemble an item, you couldn't assemble an item, no? Could it be, oh! A map or something?
