## Description
Ughh, people convinced my waifu to tell them about my secrets the last time! So I've made sure to never let her say anything meaningful to anyone else again... or at least that's what I hope. She's back now on Discord anyway as `Nadenka#7791`, this time everything should be fine... right?
